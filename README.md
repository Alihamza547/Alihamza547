      <h1><CENTER>INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTER</h1>
      <HR>
      A Computer is an electronic data processing machine or device that performs processes,calculations and operation based on  instructions
      provided by a program. Computers are now used vastly in every field of life.The advancement in computer  caused advancement in knowledge,science
      and technology.Today,computers are used in field of business,industry,education,banking,transportation,research,explorations,media,entertainment
      ,etc.</p>
      <h2>Evolation of computer</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>The computer which we see today are modern shape of computer which has been evolved in centuries.
The evolution of computer of computer is generally divided in three eras.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3>Mechanical Era (Dark Age)</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>
      Men has been tring to invent machines that can solve athematical problems.in mechanical era,human became successful to make
simple machine that can help performing simple arthmetic operation,in other word  computing.These machine was manually
operated since the electricity was not invented.
       <br>
       <b>Some of the important machine of this era are: </b>
       <b>
       <i>Abacus,Naoier's bone (1612 AD), Slide Rule (1622 AD),etc.</i>
       </p>
       <hr>
       <h4>1)Abacus(3000 B.C.)</h4
       <hr>
       <p>
       Abacus was invented about 5000 year ago.It is also known as counting frame.Abacus is still used to teach basic arithmetic 
       operations  to the students.Abacus is considered as first computer prototype.</p>
       <hr>
       <h5>2)Napier's Bones(1612 A.D.)</h5>
       <hr>
       <p>
       Scottish mathematician John Napier developed Napier's Bones,in 1612.It is also called Napier's Rods.It was a small machine 
       that contained ten rods.The rods were made up of bones,wood or metal.Napier's Bones was used for multiplication and division.</p>
       <hr>
       <h6>3)SLIDE RULE (1622 A.D.)</h6>
       <hr>
       <P>
       English mathematician William Oughtred invented a Slide Rule.This was basically a pair of two moveable rules placed slide by slide.
       They had a standardized set of markings called scales.</P> 
       <hr>
       <h7>4)Pascaline or Pascal's Calculator(1642 A.D.)</h7>
       <hr>
       <p>
       Franch mathematician Blaise Pascal invented a mechanical calculator which was called Pascaline.He developed this machine to help
       his father who was a tax collector.</p>
       <hr>
       <h8>Leibniz's Calculator(1694 A.D.)</h8>
       <hr>
       <p>
       Labniz's Calculator was developed by the German mathematicion Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz's.It was the first calculator that could 
       perform all four basic arithmetic operations;addition,subtraction,multiplication and division.
